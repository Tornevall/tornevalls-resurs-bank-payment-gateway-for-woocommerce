# Resurs Bank Plus Payment Gateway for WooCommerce #

This is a third party plugin written to work as a payment gateway for WooCommerce and WordPress. It has been approved as
a working project by Resurs developers and will therefore soon be imported as an official release for Resurs. However,
there will be breaking changes that will make it impossible to overwrite version 2.2 properly.

**NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE** **NOTE**

As PHP 7.4 is nearing its end of life this entire module requires the latest version of PHP (currently 8.1+) since for
security reasons Resurs Bank will not support versions that no longer receive updates.

Translations are currently under reconstruction as Resurs Bank has requirements of how they should look and be
implemented.

# IMPORTANT -- First time running should be on a dedicated test environment #

If you are entirely new to this plugin, I'd suggest you to run it in a dedicated test environment that is supposedly *
equal* to a production environment - where you install the plugin live *AFTER* testing. Primary new problems should be
discovered in TEST rather than production since the costs are way lower, where no real people are depending on failed
orders or payments. If something fails in production it also means that you are the one that potentially looses traffic
while your site is down.

This responsibility is yours and this way of handling things is required for *your* safety!

## Multisite/WordPress Networks ##

The plugin **do** support WordPress networks (aka multisite), however it does not support running one webservice account
over many sites at once. The main rule that Resurs Bank works with is that one webservice account only works for one
site. Running multiple sites do **require** multiple webservice accounts!

## DISCLAIMER ##

### BEWARE OF BREAKING CHANGES ###

* As PHP 7.4 is about to get outdated, this entire module requires you to upgrade to the latest release of PHP (
  currently 8.1+) since Resurs Bank is strictly require as high security as possible.

### ABOUT THIS RELEASE ###

The README you're reading right now is considered as a brand new edition, that can also potentially break something if
you tend to handle it as an upgrade from an external repository. It won't break your *site*, but configuration layers
may not be compatible. Many of the filters has, with the actions, been rewritten from scratch and is written to work
closer with other developers.

The external official public repo is located
at [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.tornevall.net/projects/WWW/repos/tornevall-networks-resurs-bank-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce)
and [github](https://github.com/Tornevall/tornevalls-resurs-bank-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce). The source code in
those repositories **are not supported by
Resurs Bank**. The code that is supported by Resurs
Bank [is always located here](https://bitbucket.org/resursbankplugins/resurs-bank-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce). The
intentions with this plugin has partially been to replace the old release in the future, which also means that it may
become externally supported one day.

The original codebase was initialized july 2020.

## REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ##

at [Code of Conduct and Migrations](https://docs.tornevall.net/display/TORNEVALL/Code+of+Conduct+and+Migrations#CodeofConductandMigrations-PHPVersions)

look at the documentation for more information.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Where can I get more information about this plugin? ###

You may visit [docs.tornevall.net](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/CoC4Aw) for more information regarding the plugin. For
questions about API and Resurs Bank please visit [test.resurs.com/docs](https://test.resurs.com/docs/).

## Can I upgrade from version 2.2.x? ##

**"Version 2.2.x"** is currently the **official Resurs Bank release** and not the same as this release that is a
practically a third party reboot. However, the intentions with this plugin is to run as seamless as possible. For
example, payments placed with the prior release can be handled by this one.

## What is considered "breaking changes"? ##

Breaking changes are collected [here](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/UwJzBQ).

Examples of what could "break" is normally in the form of "no longer supported":

* The prior payment method editor where title and description for each payment method could be edited. This is not
  really plugin side decided, but based on rules set by Resurs Bank. First of all, titles and descriptions are handled
  by Resurs Bank to simplify changes that is related to whatever could happen to a payment method. The same goes for the
  sorting of payment methods in the checkout. Some payment methods is regulated by laws and should be displayed in a
  certain order. This is no longer up to the plugin to decide and sorting is based on in which order Resurs Bank is
  returning them in the API. If you want anything changed, related to the payment method, you have to contact Resurs
  Bank support.
* Many ideas are lifted straight out from the prior version - but not all of them. Remember, this is a third party
  reboot of an old release. There are settings in this version that is no longer working as before (or at least as
  expected), especially features that is bound to filters and actions. For actions and filters, you can take a look at
  the [documentation](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/HoC4Aw). Further information about settings will come.
* Speaking of settings. Settings is almost similar to the old plugin, but with new identifiers. It is partially
  intentional done, so we don't collide with old settings. Some of them are also not very effective, so some of them has
  also been removed as they did no longer fill any purpose.

## Is this release a refactored version of Resurs Bank's? ##

No. This plugin is a complete reboot. The future intentions might be to replace the other version and **this** release
is currently considered a side project.

### Plugin is causing 40X errors on my site ###

There are several reasons for the 40X errors, but if they are thrown from an EComPHP API message, there are few things
to take in consideration:

* 401 = Unauthorized.
    - **Cause**: Bad credentials
    - **Solution**: Contact Resurs Bank support for support questions regarding API credentials.
* 403 = Forbidden.
    - **Cause**: During testing, this is a bit more common if you are using a server host that is not located in "safe
      countries".
    - **Solution:** Contact Resurs Bank for support.

### What is a EComPHP API Message? ###

From time to time, errors and exceptions shows up on your screen. Normally, when doing API calls, the messages comes
from [Resurs Bank Ecommerce API](https://test.resurs.com/docs/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5014349). Many of the
messages can be traced by Resurs Bank support, if something is unclear but many times error messages are self explained.
If you are unsure, contact the support preferrably with information about your system attached (which in the plugin's
admin interface can be found under "Support and help" or "Support och hj√§lp" in swedish). A screenshot of that layout
is attached to this plugin-repository (screenshot 8)
. [You can also see some of the error messages produced by the library itself here](https://test.resurs.com/docs/display/ecom/Errors%2C+problem+solving+and+corner+cases)
.

## I see an order but find no information connected to Resurs Bank ##

This is a common question about customer actions and how the order has been created/signed. Most of the details is
usually placed in the order notes for the order, but if you need more information you could also consider contacting
Resurs Bank support.

## How does the respective payment flows work with Resurs Bank in this plugin? ##

Full description about how "simplifiedShopFlow", "hosted flow" and "Resurs Checkout" works, not only here, but mostly
anywhere can be seen at [https://docs.tornevall.net/x/IAAkBQ](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/IAAkBQ)
