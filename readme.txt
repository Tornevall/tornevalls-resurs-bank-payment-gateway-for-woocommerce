Resurs Bank Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

A payment is expected to be simple, secure and fast, regardless of whether it takes place in a physical store or online. With over 6 million customers around the Nordics, we make sure to be up-to-date with smart payment solutions where customers shop.

At checkout, your customer can choose between several flexible payment options, something that not only provides a better shopping experience but also generates more and larger purchases.
