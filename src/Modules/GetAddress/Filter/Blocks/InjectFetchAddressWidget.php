/**
 * Inject the fetch address widget into the checkout content.
 *
 * We inject the widget this way because:
 *
 * 1. Creating a custom block for the widget isn't useful if you only intend
 *    to use it in a single place, especially when the block will render static
 *    content the user cannot modify through the WordPress editor.
 *
 * 2. The WooCommerce Checkout page is a block of its own, which means a custom
 *    WordPress block can be injected before or after it, but not in the middle
 *    of it. This means that we would either need to tweak the block to make
 *    WooCommerce recognize it properly, or we would need to use JavaScript to
 *    move the rendered component on the frontend.
 *
 * 3. By using a block, we would require the integrating client to add the block
 *    manually to the WooCommerce checkout page in WordPress, which may cause
 *    confusion and increase support overhead.
 *
 * Because of the above, it's simply easier to inject the widget directly into
 * the rendered content.
