/**
 * Inject fetch address widget in checkout content.
 *
 * We inject the widget this way because:
 *
 * 1. Creating a custom block for the widget isn't useful if you only intend
 * to use it in a single place, especially when the block will render static
 * content the user cannot affect through the WordPress editor.
 *
 * 2. WooCommerce Checkout page is a block of its own, which means a custom
 * WordPress block can be injected before or after it, not in the middle of it.
 * Which means that we either would need to tweak the block to make WooCommerce
 * recognize it properly, or we would need to use JavaScript to move the rendered
 * component on frontend.
 *
 * 3. By using a block we would require the integrating client to add the block
 * manually to the WooCommerce checkout page in WordPress, which may cause
 * confusion and overhead in support.
 *
 * Because of the above, it's simply easier to inject the widget directly into
 * the rendered content.
